# Tinkoff hackathon

TInkoff is one of the biggest russian banks, so on the hackathon they gave us an issue that they face every day: when is to stop a partner's cashback promotion?

In the Tinkoff app users have discounts on specific brands that partened with Tinkoff. These brands agreed to cover the discount by themself, in the return for the promotion. But they don't want to pay more then certain amount, so it's Tinkoff's job to end the promotion at the right time, otherwise Tinkoff needs to repay the excess.

So we used analytical methods to calculate the approximated end date of partner's cashback promotion.
